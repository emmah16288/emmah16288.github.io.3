    <h2>10. Fruit</h2>

      <p>This may be controversial but fruit should be a dessert! Or at least a treat. They are refreshing and sweet, what else defines a dessert?</p>
    <h2>9. Frosting</h2>
      <p>Frosting is great to eat on its own. Who needs actual cake? It can be quite sweet but is not something I would skip out on.</p>
    <h2>8. Brownies</h2>
      <p>Chocolate heaven!! Brownies are the best for chocolate lovers. They are both fudgey and chocolatey. They are amazing treats to share with friends and family so be sure to bake them for events!</p>
    <h2>7. Ice Cream</h2>
      <p>The perfect treat for a hot, sunny day. Be sure to bring some to the beach!! </p>
    <h2>6. Cookies</h2>
      <p>The best with warm milk. They can never go wrong. Either crunchy or soft, they are both amazing!!</p>
    <h2>5. Cake</h2>
      <p>The go-to dessert for any special events! Cake is something you can never tire of!!</p>
    <h2>4. Donuts</h2>
      <p>The best breakfast someone can ever have. Great with hot coffee to create a perfect morning.</p>
    <h2>3. Churros</h2>
      <p>The ultimate snack. Both sweet and warm for a nice chilly day.</p>
    <h2>2. Mochi</h2>
      <p>An amazing treat that can be filled with whatever your heart desires!!</p>
    <h2>1. Macarons</h2>
      <p>The most expensive, but most delicious!! No matter the cost, it is always worth it. They melt in your mouth and are a must try!!</p>
